<p>“…CCE (is) an integral part of school life. This is important because we all want our children to do well individually, but it is also very important that they are committed to a larger purpose beyond themselves. Our students should feel a strong sense of duty and responsibility to their fellow citizens; and a readiness to serve and help others succeed…”<br>Mr Lawrence Wong, Minister of Education at the NUS 115 Distinguished Speaker Series – Shaping the Future of Education, 3 December 2020</p>
<p>The design of the school’s CCE Curriculum takes reference from MOE’s CCE 2021 Curriculum Frame and Goals (below) and is anchored on the school’s vision, mission and values.&nbsp;</p>

<p>CZPS vision of “An Innovative Thinker, A Gracious Leader, An Engaged Citizen” is in line with our belief that Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) is key in developing holistically-educated pupils.</p>
<p><strong>CZPS CCE Vision:</strong>&nbsp;To develop responsible and discerning citizens.</p>
<p>In CPZS, CCE is integrated and infused in both curriculum and co-curriculum programmes for an overall school experience of the students. The school is committed to provide all students with an equal opportunity to support their different needs and develop their potentials.</p>
<p>Through the inculcation of positive values and building of social emotional (SE) competencies, the school aims to develop students as citizens of good character in a rapidly changing and globalized world, and achieve the eight CCE learning outcomes (LOs).</p>

<p>The CCE student-centred programmes are guided by the three key concepts of CCE – Identity, Relationship and Choices, and designed with the CZ Experience of “Know It”, “Feel It’ and “Live It” in mind.&nbsp;</p>

<p>CCE curriculum comprises CCE Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) sessions, CCE Mother Tongue Language (MTL) lessons as well as Programme for Active Learning (PAL). Student development experiences (SDEs) like the National Education (NE) Commemorative Days, Co-curricular (CCA) Activities, Project Work cum VIA and Student Leadership Development through the school’s distinctive programme reinforce the formal CCE curriculum. The various key programmes and activities are integrated into every level to equip our students with the necessary knowledge, skills and values.</p>
