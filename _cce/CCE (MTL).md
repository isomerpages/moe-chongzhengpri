<h4><strong>CCE MTL (Mother Tongue Language)</strong></h4>
<p>At the primary school level, CCE (known as Civics and Moral Education (CME) prior to 2014) has been taught in the Mother Tongue Languages as they hold a rich source of knowledge for the transmission of values. The teaching of CCE in the MTLs also provides additional exposure time so as to improve students&rsquo; competency in Chinese, Malay and Tamil.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To deepen the learning of CCE values (as illustrated in the figure below) as well as the Social and Emotional Competencies such as responsible decision making, cultural stories, practices, proverbs or songs unique to each MTL are selected to support the teaching and learning of values. For students taking the Non-Tamil Indian Language and those exempted from the Chinese, Malay and Indian Language, CCE MTL is conducted in English.</p>
