<p><strong>3. PAM Festival</strong>
</p>
<p>Each year, our school hosts a vibrant, week-long Art Festival, filled
with a variety of creative activities for students to enjoy during recess.
Throughout the week, specially designed art lessons are conducted to inspire
students and deepen their artistic skills. The event culminates in a unique
integration of PE and Art, where students get to apply both disciplines
by designing and crafting their own medals or trophies. This exciting blend
of creativity and physical education encourages self-expression, teamwork,
and a sense of achievement for all participants.</p>
