<p><strong>Our Approach to Music Learning</strong>·&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Chongzheng Primary School, our Music curriculum nurtures every child’s
innate musical potential through engaging and meaningful learning experiences.
Guided by the musical processes of <strong>Listening, Creating, and Performing</strong>,
students explore diverse genres and traditions while developing 21st Century
Competencies. Our aim is for students to build strong musical skills and
understanding of key concepts, while deepening their appreciation of Singapore’s
rich cultural heritage and the wider world of music. Above all, we want
them to express themselves with joy, creativity, and confidence through
music.</p>
<p><strong>Spiral Music Curriculum</strong>
</p>
<p>We adopt a spiral curriculum where learning builds progressively across
the six years of primary school:</p>
<p>•<strong>Primary 1 and 2</strong>
</p>
<p>Students discover the heartbeat of music through active listening, singing,
and playing <strong>resonator bells</strong>,<strong> Boomwhackers</strong> and <strong>classroom percussion instruments</strong>.
They develop inventive thinking through creative sound exploration and
experiencing music from different cultures.</p>

<p>We adopt a spiral curriculum where learning builds progressively across
the six years of primary school:</p>
<p>•<strong>Primary 3 and 4</strong>
</p>
<p>Students expand their horizons by exploring songs from diverse cultures.
They learn instruments such as the <strong>ukulele </strong>and <strong>xylophone</strong>,
as well as traditional cultural instruments like <strong>Indian</strong> and <strong>Chinese percussion</strong>.
They strengthen communication skills through ensemble work and deepen their
understanding of musical elements, and cultural expressions.</p>

<p>•<strong>Primary 5 and 6</strong>
</p>
<p>Students refine their skills through ensemble experiences, such as forming
a <strong>pop band </strong>and <strong>angklung ensemble</strong>. They
create their own arrangements, explore more complex musical skills and
concepts, and grow in collaboration, global awareness, and civic literacy.</p>

<p><strong>Instrumental Focus</strong>
</p>
<p>Our core instrumental programme centres on the <strong>Xylophone </strong>and <strong>Ukulele</strong> from
Primary 3 onwards, providing both melodic and harmonic foundations. This
is complemented by a variety of percussion and cultural instruments, including
Chinese and Indian percussion and the angklung, connecting students to
Singapore’s multicultural and global music landscape.</p>
<p><strong>Beyond the Classroom</strong>
</p>
<p>We believe in providing authentic platform for our students to share their
music. These opportunities allow them to <strong>apply what they have learnt in the classroom</strong>,
nurturing confidence and performance skills through dedicated showcase
platforms:</p>
<p>•<strong>CZnergy (Talent Showcase)</strong>
</p>

<p>More than a talent show, CZnergy (pronounced <em>synergy</em>) is our student-led
performance platform that celebrates creativity, collaboration, and joy.
It reflects our belief that <strong>the whole is greater than the sum of its parts</strong>,
and provides a safe and inclusive space for students to grow as:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Creators</strong> – planning, choreographing, or adapting performances
that reflect their identity and voice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Connectors</strong> – building confidence in expressing themselves,
whether as part of a group or in engaging with the audience</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Contributors</strong> – offering their talents to uplift the school
community and celebrate one another</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Through CZnergy, students shine as individuals while strengthening the
bonds of the Chongzheng community.</p>
