<p>Throughout the 2 weeks, our pupils are engaged with a series of activities
that expose them to the usage of their Mother Language in a fun manner.
For the Chinese Language department, activates arranged for pupils include
celebrating Chinese New Year, clay making (泥塑), Chinese Finger Painting
(指画), Tea-appreciation activity, Read @ Recess by Principal and English
medium teachers in their own Mother Tongue Language. For the Malay Language

Tongue Language with great excitement.</p>
<p>2. Happy Recess @Happy Ocean</p>
<p>To extend the learning of Mother Tongue Languages beyond classroom, “Happy
Ocean” was set up in the school in 2017. In this cozy area, pupils have
the opportunity to interact with their peers using their Mother Tongue
Languages through fun activities during recess. Under the supervision and
guidance of our PaVE members and selected Mother Tongue Language student-leaders,
pupils play various language games like Boggle, Word Dominoes and Chinese
Chess.</p>
<p>3. Infusing of Innovation Thinking Tools into the learning of Mother Tongue
Language. With the objective of nurturing innovation and creativity in
our pupils, we infused Thinking Protocols into our daily teaching as well

&amp; Six-thinking Hats are tools chosen for our pupils to carry out during
their group discussion.</p>
