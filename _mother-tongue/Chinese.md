<p>Throughout the 2 weeks, our pupils are engaged with a series of activities
that expose them to the usage of their Mother Language in a fun manner.
For the Chinese Language department, activates arranged for pupils include
celebrating Chinese New Year, clay making (泥塑), Chinese Finger Painting
(指画), Tea-appreciation activity, Read @ Recess by Principal and English
medium teachers in their own Mother Tongue Language. For the Malay Language

<p>2. Happy Recess @Happy Ocean</p>
<p>To extend the learning of Mother Tongue Languages beyond classroom, “Happy
Ocean” was set up in the school in 2017. In this cozy area, pupils have
the opportunity to interact with their peers using their Mother Tongue
Languages through fun activities during recess. Under the supervision and
guidance of our PaVE members and selected Mother Tongue Language student-leaders,
pupils play various language games like Boggle, Word Dominoes and Chinese
Chess.</p>
<p>3. Infusing of Innovation Thinking Tools into the learning of Mother Tongue
Language. With the objective of nurturing innovation and creativity in

their group discussion.</p>

<p>We are delighted to share the latest updates of our Reading Programme
from Chinese Language Department! This term has been filled with a variety
of activities aimed at enhancing students' reading journeys.</p>
<p>Our in-class reading sessions provide students with immersive experiences,
exposing them to a diverse range of texts and cultivating their understanding.
Library time continues in its traditional fashion, offering students the
opportunity to independently explore a rich array of Chinese literary works.
These activities, along with designated time for lower primary students,
encourage students to engage in intentional reading of Chinese language
storybooks.</p>
<p>We are equally thrilled by the success of our "Reading Parents" initiative.
This programme encourages parental involvement, allowing Primary one and
two students to participate in guided reading activities during break time
at "Happy Ocean." Additionally, they engage in story-related crafts designed
by teachers. This initiative, bolstered by illustrated books, further enhances
student involvement in reading.</p>
<p>As the term progresses, we remain dedicated to providing captivating experiences,
nurturing students' lifelong love for reading, and promoting academic growth.</p>
<p>We extend our heartfelt gratitude for your continuous support and collaboration
throughout this exciting journey!</p>
<p>&nbsp;我们非常荣幸地与大家分享崇正华文部阅读计划的最新动态！本学期，我们举办了丰富多彩的活动，旨在提升学生的阅读之旅。</p>
<p>我们的课堂阅读时间为学生提供了沉浸式的体验，让他们接触到各种不同的文本，培养了学生的理解能力。《图书馆时间》依然延续了往年的模式，让学生们有机会独立探索丰富多样的中文文学作品。这些活动和特定时间鼓励学生有意识地阅读中文书籍。</p>
<p>我们同样对我们“阅读家长”计划的成功感到欣喜。该计划鼓励家长参与，让一年级和二年级的学生在休息时间到“快乐洋”进行导读活动，同时参与老师们设计的与故事相关的手工制作。导读活动通过绘本进一步增强，并吸引学生参与阅读。</p>
<p>接下来的日子，我们将继续致力于提供引人入胜的体验，培养学生终身热爱阅读的习惯，促进学术成长。</p>
<p>感谢您一直以来在这充满激动人心的旅程中的支持和合作！</p>
