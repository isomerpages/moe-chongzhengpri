<p>The starfish story tells us that every child is precious and important to us which aptly illustrates our School's Guiding Principle &ndash; &ldquo;Every Child Matters Every Staff Matters&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Starfish Story</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Once, an old man was walking along a beach. The sun was shining and it was a beautiful day. Off in the distance, he could see a boy going back and forth between the surf's edge and the beach. Back and forth this boy went. As the old man approached, he could see that there were hundreds of starfish stranded on the sand as a result of the natural action of the tide. The old man was struck by the apparent futility of the task. There were too many starfish. Many of them were sure to perish. As he approached, the boy continued the task of picking up starfish one by one and throwing them into the surf.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">As he came to the boy, he said, "There are thousands of miles of beach covered with starfish. You can't possibly make a difference." The boy looked at the old man. He then stooped down and picked up one more starfish and threw it back into the ocean. He turned back to the old man and said, "It sure made a difference to that one!"</p>
