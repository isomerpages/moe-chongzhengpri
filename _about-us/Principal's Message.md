<p align="justify">Welcome to Chongzheng Primary School, and thank you for stopping by our school website. This website is updated regularly and tells you about our school and all the exciting happenings that make school life such a joy.
</p><p align="justify">The school year is undoubtedly a busy one, with the calendar packed full of activities that aim to provide a varied set of experiences for both our students and staff. As always, we are very happy to have the&nbsp; <strong>support of our stakeholders</strong>&nbsp;(School Advisory Committee, Parent Support Group – PaVE, parents, alumni, and our partners) to enable the successful implementation of different school initiatives and events.
</p><p align="justify">Education in the 21st century is constantly transforming, with new media and evolving technology (including artificial intelligence) catering to the learning needs and interests of the&nbsp;<strong>21st Century learner</strong>&nbsp;. Our Minister for Education, Mr Chan Chun Sing, emphasized the need for teachers, and indeed, schools to equip our students with 21st Century competencies and skills that do not merely solve today's problems with yesterday's and today’s solutions, but can solve tomorrow's problems with tomorrow's solutions. To support this, in the enhanced 21CC framework for education in Singapore, launched in late 2023,&nbsp;<strong> adaptive thinking</strong>&nbsp; has been added as an emerging 21st century competency that students of this generation need to develop, alongside the usual critical thinking, problem-solving, communication skills as well as cross-cultural literacy. 
</p><p align="justify">At Chongzheng, we recognize that our students are digital natives, immersed in a world of technology from a young age. We therefore undertake to help them embrace this advantage and&nbsp;<strong> leverage EdTech</strong>&nbsp; tools to enhance their learning experience. However, even when they engage in interactive learning experiences in the virtual world, or collaborate using online platforms, the school does not forget to inculcate the aforementioned 21CC in them, and ensures that the school experience anchors on fundamental core values (&nbsp;<strong>Respect, Responsibility, Integrity, Steadfastness, Empathy, Confidence</strong>&nbsp;) to learn ethically and responsibly. 
</p><p align="justify">In the fertile ground of our school, &nbsp;<strong>every child is a flower waiting to blossom</strong>&nbsp;. We would like our students to navigate the complexities and intricacies of this ambiguous but exciting new world with a spirit of curiosity and courage. We believe in recognizing the unique talents and dreams that lie within every child. Our diverse learning environment comes with the dedication of our staff, both teaching and non-teaching. In partnership with parents, we seek to provide the nourishment and sunlight needed for every child to bloom.
</p><p align="justify">As we approach our 40th anniversary in 2025, we embark on a new chapter, guided by our Vision: "&nbsp;<strong>A Vibrant Community of Innovative Thinkers and Exemplary Leaders</strong>&nbsp;." This vision, born from the "Re-imagining Chongzheng" initiative, paints a future where our students thrive as creative problem-solvers and compassionate leaders, ready to shape the world.
</p><p align="justify">Our enduring Mission, "&nbsp;<strong>To nurture the leader in everyone with a heart to give and a mind to grow</strong>&nbsp;," underpins our strategic direction. Through our four strategic thrusts—a holistic curriculum, the Chongzheng Distinctive Programme, skilful and engaged staff, and organizational excellence—we cultivate "confident individuals, passionate learners, innovative thinkers, and exemplary leaders." But our impact goes beyond students. We strive for staff outcomes of "skilful professionals, collaborative learners, and innovative practitioners," while fostering a "forward-looking organization" dedicated to "service excellence." This holistic approach ensures that every member of our community, from students to staff, blossoms into their future-ready selves.
</p><p align="justify">Guiding our journey is our school Motto, "&nbsp;<strong>Confident and Steadfast</strong>&nbsp;." This timeless principle has served as a compass, anchoring us through changes in the educational landscape. We invite you to explore our website further and discover the vibrant world of Chongzheng Primary School. We are excited to welcome you to our community and partner with you on this journey of learning and growth.
</p><p align="justify">All the best for 2024!</p>
