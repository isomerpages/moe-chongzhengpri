<p align="justify">Welcome to Chongzheng Primary School, and thank you for stopping by our school website. This website is updated regularly and tells you about our school and all the exciting happenings that make school life such a joy.
</p><p align="justify">The past three years have no doubt been very challenging ones for our students and staff. However, we stand resolute and united in battling Covid together, and I must salute everyone for staying strong and positive. Our stakeholders (parents, alumni, SAC, and our partners) have also continued to be supportive of our activities and initiatives, and I am proud to say that we have not lost touch with them during this difficult period.
</p><p align="justify">With life now returning to (almost) normal, we continue to stay vigilant and observe the relevant Safe Management Measures (SMM), while at the same time, never losing sight of our bigger purpose, which is&nbsp;<strong>to nurture the leader in everyone with a heart to give and a mind to grow</strong>&nbsp;(our school Mission).
</p><p align="justify">The school management team and teachers have been involved in a “Re-imagining Chongzheng” exercise since 2022, and this journey will continue into 2023. We have revised our school Vision to be <strong>“A Vibrant Community of Innovative Thinkers and Exemplary Leaders”.</strong>&nbsp;This revised Vision pays homage to the wonderful work of everyone at CZPS from the past and present, as well as reveals our hopes and aspirations for Chongzheng Primary School as we move into the future.
</p><p align="justify">To be an&nbsp;innovative thinker&nbsp;means to think of creative and new ways to analyse issues and solve problems.
</p><p align="justify">To be an&nbsp;exemplary leader&nbsp;means to lead in a way that shows us role-modelling and doing good by ourselves and by others too.
</p><p align="justify">All in all, we see our school as “a vibrant community”, which signifies the hustle and bustle of school life, and how everyone comes together as a cohesive group with our shared experiences.
</p><p align="justify">Paired with our Mission, we want everyone here at Chongzheng to experience school life to the fullest, develop our minds and also continue to give back to the wider community.&nbsp; In time to come, we will also re-look at our school Values and look for enhancements that can reflect the anchors which we use to develop each and every Chongzheng star.
</p><p align="justify">Close to our heart is also&nbsp;<strong>our school Motto, “Confident and Steadfast”,</strong>&nbsp;which reminds us of our beginnings, and what the school sets out to inculcate in every Chongzheng student. Besides that,&nbsp;“Living and Learning in Chongzheng”&nbsp;is not just a line in our school song. It is a line we take seriously and we seek to provide the “Best Day Ever” for our children when they learn, play and interact with others both in and out of the classroom. With the Growth Mindset as one of our basis for development, we are confident that 2023 will be a wonderful year for us here at Chongzheng, and we remain steadfast in the face of challenges that may come our way.
</p><p align="justify">Enjoy navigating the website, and see for yourself, how vibrant school life is at Chongzheng.
<br>All the best for 2023!</p>
