<p>Greetings and welcome to Chongzheng Primary School’s website! This is
our official presence online and is updated regularly to inform and share
essential information on our school. We aim to create the <strong>Best Day Ever</strong> experience
for all the students that pass through our gate and we thank parents for
entrusting their children with us.</p>
<p>This year is particularly special for our school, as we turn <strong>40</strong> years
old! The school has been blessed to be serving the Tampines community the
past 40 years, producing cohorts of contributors to society. With the enthusiasm
of our students, the dedication of our staff, as well as support from the
respective stakeholders (School Advisory Committee, Parent Support Group
– PaVE, parents, alumni, and our partners), the school has reached a milestone
that brings about a sense of accomplishment and a feeling of joy.</p>
<p>The school started off in the late 20th century, and right now, we are
exactly at the quarter mark of the 21st century. Without a doubt, education
has transformed since the early days of Chongzheng, just like how our country
Singapore has evolved. As such, our theme for commemorating the 40th anniversary
is “Celebrating our Heritage, Embracing the Future”.</p>
<p>We are now educating the 21st century learner, and are implementing programmes
that cater to their needs and interests. Anchoring on the <strong>enhanced 21CC framework</strong> for
schools as well as leveraging emerging <strong>EdTech</strong> tools such
as AI, we seek to enhance the students’ learning experiences and in the
process also inculcate values that build an innovative thinker and exemplary
leader.</p>
<p>We believe that <strong>every child is a flower waiting to blossom</strong> here
in our school. We would like our students to navigate the complexities
and intricacies of this ambiguous but exciting new world with a spirit
of curiosity and courage. We believe in recognizing the unique talents
and dreams that lie within every child. Our diverse learning environment
comes with the dedication of our staff, both teaching and non-teaching.
In partnership with parents, we seek to provide the nourishment and sunlight
needed for every child to bloom.</p>
<p>Keeping our school Motto, "<strong>Confident and Steadfast</strong>",
close to our hearts, we respect this timeless principle as our guiding
compass to help us navigate changes in the educational landscape. We remain
confident that we can develop every learner that comes in through the gates
of Chongzheng, and are steadfast in fulfilling our mission for every Chongzheng
student to graduate successfully as a leader with a Heart to Give and a
Mind To Grow.</p>
<p>Do feel free to explore our website further and discover the vibrant world
of Chongzheng Primary School. We are excited to welcome you to our community
and partner with you on this journey of learning and growth.</p>
<p>All the best for 2025!</p>
