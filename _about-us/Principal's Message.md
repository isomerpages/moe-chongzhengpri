<p>Welcome to Chongzheng Primary School, and thank you for stopping by our school website. Our school website has undergone a facelift at the end of last year (2021) and we hope you will enjoy going through the pages to learn more about our school.</p>
<p>We are into the third year of the pandemic, and while we have gotten used to wearing masks, washing our hands more frequently and wiping down in school, we really hope for life to return to the times where we could interact more with people.</p>
<p>The disruptions we have experienced have certainly made us stronger. For example, we are more conscious of personal hygiene and also more civic-minded when we interact with others. In school, there are good practices put in place, such as regular wipe-down, sitting at designated places in class and during recess, and thorough washing of hands.</p>
<p>In terms of learning, we also discover that there are so many different ways to learn, in particular,&nbsp;<strong>Blended Learning</strong>. I am happy to say that at Chongzheng, our teachers and students have embraced new ways to learn and are able to be very creative too. Of course, while we work a lot with technology to learn with one another, we still value the importance of face-to-face interaction in our school campus, and we do our best to provide opportunities to interact face-to-face even as we observe safe-distancing.</p>
<p>At Chongzheng, we hold dear our school&rsquo;s Vision, Mission, Values, Motto and Guiding Principle. In particular, Chongzheng provides the environment where every student can strive to be&nbsp;<strong>a leader, with a heart to give and a mind to grow</strong>. This is our mission, which we set out to achieve for every student who passes through the gates of Chongzheng. We sincerely believe that every student has the ability to lead himself or herself, and become a role model too for other to emulate. With a heart to give, the Chongzheng student is inclusive and cares for others in school and the community. Finally, with a mind to grow, the Chongzheng student embraces new experiences and is able to look at things from different perspectives to gain new learning.</p>
<p>The above cannot be achieved overnight, but with the meaningful 6 years spent in Chongzheng, we are confident that&nbsp;<strong>every Chongzheng star can shine</strong>, as you will see through the different programmes and happenings of the school in this website. We endeavour to make everyday a&nbsp;<strong>Best Day Ever</strong>!</p>
<p>Explore the website at your leisure and happy 2022!</p>
