<h4><strong>Big Buddy Programme</strong></h4>
<p>The first few days of Primary 1, while exciting, can also be frightening and confusing. The Big Buddy Programme matches every Primary 1 student with a Primary 2 big buddy.</p>

<p>The Big Buddies' roles include showing them how to buy food, return their cutlery and even where to play when they are done. This eases the transition period the young ones have to go through. Being so close in age, the big buddies are also better able to empathise with what their younger buddies are going through.</p>
