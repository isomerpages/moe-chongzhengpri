<h4><strong>MATHEMATICS DEPARTMENT VISION</strong></h4>
<p>Students to be innovative problem-solvers and so to apply Mathematics in real life situations</p>
<h4><strong>MATHEMATICS DEPARTMENT PROGRAMMES</strong></h4>
<p><u><strong>Learning experiences through Activity-Based Learning (ABL)</strong></u></p>
<p>Students learn Mathematics in meaningful ways by using manipulatives and working with their peers. Through these activities, students construct their mathematical meaning through collaborative learning. When learning is meaningful, students are engaged and want to learn more.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><u>STAR approach in problem solving</u></strong></p>
<p>In the solving of word problems, we advocate the acronym of STAR to enable students to systematically search for clues in the word problems and to apply the appropriate plan to solve them.</p>

<p><strong><u>Talent Management</u></strong></p>
<p>Mathematics Olympiad Training is provided for Primary 4, 5 and 6 students who show passion and aptitude in advanced Math problem solving. As part of the programme, our students will take part in Mathematics Olympiad Competitions</p>
<p><strong><u>Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM)</u></strong></p>
<p>Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM) is an early intervention programme started by MOE for Primary 1 and 2 students who lack foundational numeracy skills. A trained LSM teacher will provide daily teaching to these students in a small group setting to assist them to master their numeracy skills.</p>
