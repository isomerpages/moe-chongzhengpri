<p><strong>Description:&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>The main aim of Digital Media is to excite students by exposing them to
various ICT tools and experience. Digital Media members participate in
weekly workshops to learn various software and Information and Communication
Technology (ICT) skills. These include animation, photography and video
editing skills. In addition, they learn proper handling of audio visual
equipment as well as research skills. Members have also recently embarked
on basic coding where they have learnt to create interesting computer games
and mobile apps, and also robotics.</p>
<p>Pupils who show potential will represent the school to participate in
competitions at national level, such as the annual Schools Digital Media
Awards (SDMA), National Schools Photography Competition and many more.</p>
