<p><strong>Description:&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>The uniqueness of angklung lies in its requirement of multiple angklung
players to create a symphony as one angklung instrument only produce one
musical note. Therefore, the ensemble must collaborate seamlessly to play
a melody. The Angklung Ensemble CCA trains the students to be focused and
dedicated towards the ensemble as each member has an important role to
make the music come alive.</p>
<p>The Angklung Ensemble participated in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF)
2024 and, under the guidance of our dedicated instructor, Ms Faridah, achieved
a commendable "Accomplishment" award. The Ensemble was also honored with
an invitation to perform alongside the Raffles Girls' School (RGS) Angklung
Ensemble at their schoolâ€™s Nubula concert, providing an invaluable experience
for our members.</p>
<p>We wish to inform that the Angklung Ensemble will no longer be offered
as a Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) from 2025 onwards. We extend our heartfelt
gratitude to Ms Faridah for her unwavering dedication and to our parents
for their continuous support over the years.</p>
