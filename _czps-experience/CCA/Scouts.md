<p><strong>Description:&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>Guided by the Scout Law and Promise, the Cub Scouts programme nurtures
each student's holistic development through a wide range of engaging and
meaningful activities. Through their participation, Cub Scouts grow physically,
intellectually, emotionally, socially, and spiritually—becoming responsible
individuals and active contributors to society.</p>
<p>During our CCA sessions, Cub Scouts take part in activities such as Job
Week, Donation Draw, First Aid Courses, Outdoor Cooking, and Camping. These
experiences help them build essential life skills while fostering a strong
sense of teamwork and service.</p>
<p>Cub Scouts also work towards achieving their Progress Badges, ranging
from Bronze to Gold, during weekly unit meetings. In addition, they are
encouraged to take initiative in pursuing Proficiency Badges independently,
allowing them to explore personal interests and deepen their Scouting journey.</p>
