<p><strong>Description:&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>Always guided by the Scouts Law and Promise, each cub scout acquires different
skills and values to be a more holistic person through the different scouting
activities during our CCA sessions. It helps to develop the Cub Scout’s
full physical, intellectual, emotional, social and spiritual capacities
as individuals and as members of society, and thus contribute to the development
of a better world. The various activities which Cub Scouts participate
include Job Week, Donation Drawing, First Aid Course, Outdoor Cooking and
Camping. During our unit meetings, we conduct activities which allow the
attainment of the progress badges, from Bronze to Gold. Cub scouts are
also encouraged to do their scouting activities independently through the
proficiency badges. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
