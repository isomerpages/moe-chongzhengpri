<p><strong>Description:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Always guided by the Scouts Law and Promise, each cub scout acquires different skills and values to be a more holistic person through the different scouting activities during our CCA sessions. It helps to develop the cub scoutâ€™s full physical, intellectual, emotional, social and spiritual capacities as individuals and as members of society, and thus contribute to the development of a better world. The various activities which cub scouts participate include Job Week, Donation Drawing, First Aid Course, Outdoor Cooking and Camping. During our unit meetings, we conduct activities which allow the attainment of the progress badges, from bronze to gold. Cub scouts are also encouraged to do their scouting activities independently through the proficiency badges. &nbsp;</p>
