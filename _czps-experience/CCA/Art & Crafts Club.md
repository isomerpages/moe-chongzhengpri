<p><strong>Description :</strong>
</p>
<p>CZPS Art and Craft is a vibrant platform that brings together students
with a passion for art, encouraging them to express their creativity through
various mediums.</p>
<p>Our weekly sessions, led by experienced Art Vendor and guided by dedicated
Art teachers, offer students the chance to explore diverse techniques and
materials like paint, wire, batik dyes, printing ink, and mixed media.</p>
<p>Students engage in hands-on activities, experimenting with art forms such
as metal tooling, silk screen printing, batik, acrylic painting, and quilling.
These experiences nurture their creativity, artistic skills, and self-expression.</p>
<p>In addition, our annual art learning journeys enrich students’ understanding
of the arts in Singapore. These trips expand their knowledge of local history
and highlight the works of Singaporean artists and also appreciate works
of masters.</p>
<p>Art Club also includes the Community Enrichment Programme (CEP) and Community
Involvement Programme (CIP), where students gain valuable experiences that
further enhance their artistic growth while giving back to the community.</p>
