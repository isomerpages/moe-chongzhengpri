<p><strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong></p>
<p>Girl Guides (Brownies) are 9 to 12 year old girls who enjoy learning and having amazing adventures together!</p>
<p>Girl Guides (Brownies) are encouraged to explore and discover the world around them and to become more independent. They are constantly learning new skills and challenged to try new and adventurous activities that will inspire them to think about what they want to be and do in the future.</p>
<p>Girl Guides (Brownies) learn to work and play independently and also in teams. On special occasions, Girl Guides (Brownies) do fun things together with other Girl Guides (Brownies) units for joint learning adventures! Activities may include Division Days and outdoor cooking. Along the way, they learn to care for one another and other people around them and make lasting friendships.</p>
<p>Girl Guides (Brownies) are guided by a comprehensive 5-Point Programme, which develops them in 5 areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Personal &amp; Social Development &ndash; Healthy Me, Courteous Me, Cultured Me</li>
<li>Home &ndash; Home Safety &amp; Duties</li>
<li>Outdoor &ndash; Discovering Nature, A Green World</li>
<li>Community &ndash; My Country, My Neighbourhood, Helper</li>
<li>International &ndash; My Girl Guides (Brownie Friend), My World</li>
</ul>
<p>Girl Guides (Brownies) enjoy working for interest badges and awards that will help them develop new skills.</p>
<p><strong>2021:</strong></p>
<p>This year, the girls participated actively in the competitions during the East Division Day 2021. The theme for the event was &lsquo;Girls making a difference&rsquo; and due to COVID-19, the competitions were decentralised.</p>
<p>The girls worked well together and they put a lot of effort in planning and creating their submissions. We are happy to share that we won:</p>
<ol>
<li>First place in the dance competition</li>
<li>Third place in the eco-friendly recycled fashion and cheerleading</li>
<li>Fourth place for the skit/singing competition.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>Congratulations to our Brownies for their excellent team work!</p>
