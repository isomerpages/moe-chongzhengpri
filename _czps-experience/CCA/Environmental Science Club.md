<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>In the STEM &amp; Environment Club, we aim to raise a generation of young people who display the passion to conserve the environment, aligned with the Singapore Green Plan 2030, and become eco-stewards of Singapore. From 2024, the club will be using design thinking to solve the challenges they face, and infuse Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) into their learning.</p>
<p>We also aim to empower our eco-stewards to be Environmental Ambassadors of Chongzheng Primary School, and encourage their peers to champion sound sustainability practices, such as reducing food waste, energy use and plastic waste, becoming confident people who are concerned about sustainability and want to create a positive impact to the environment.</p>
<p><strong>Below are some activities we have done:</strong></p>
<p>1) Visit to Sustainability@Tampines Park to learn more about reducing food waste by using black soldier fly larvae.</p>
