<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>In Environment Club, we aim to raise a generation of young people who display the passion to conserve the environment.</p>
<p>We also aim to equip our students with 21st century competencies such as communication, collaborative and information skills, global awareness and cross-cultural skills as well as critical and inventive skills, so that they can become confident people who are concerned about what our Planet Earth is going through and actively contribute to a better living environment.</p>
<p><strong>To help us achieve our aims, we engage our students in the following activities:</strong></p>
<p>1) Group projects for events such as World Water Day, Youth for the Environment Day and World Food Day</p>
