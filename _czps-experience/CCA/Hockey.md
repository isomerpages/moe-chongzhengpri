<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>The hockey team members learn the basics of hockey skills and play in team games of 3v3 (Pri. 4 pupils) and 5v5 for the junior teams (Pri. 5 pupils) and 6v6 for the senior teams (Pri. 6 pupils). Besides training on Tuesday mornings during CCA periods, pupils attend extra training on Tuesday and Friday afternoons for two and a half hours each time. Hockey members also take part in friendly and competitive matches organised by our own school, other schools, external hockey clubs and inter-school competitions including the National School Games.</p>
