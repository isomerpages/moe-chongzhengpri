<p><strong>Description:</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Speech and Drama CCA is a vibrant and engaging club committed to cultivating
students' confidence, creativity, and performance abilities. Through a
variety of hands-on activities—including rehearsals, professional coaching,
and opportunities to perform on stage—members are empowered to express
themselves, develop essential public speaking skills, and grow as performers
in a supportive and inspiring environment.</p>
<p>This year, all members of our Speech and Drama CCA took part in the CZ40
Musical—Celebrating Our Past, Embracing Our Future. Instead of simply attending
an external musical, our students had the unique opportunity to perform
at an external venue, allowing them to experience the excitement and challenges
of a professional stage environment. Our sessions were dedicated to rehearsals
and training under the guidance of a professional acting coach, ensuring
that every student was well-prepared for the stage performance. This hands-on
experience not only strengthened their acting and stage presence but also
boosted their confidence and adaptability as they learned to engage with
a live audience outside the school setting.</p>
<p>Every student who joins Speech and Drama CCA will indeed embark on a transformative
journey of creativity, self-expression, and personal growth.</p>
