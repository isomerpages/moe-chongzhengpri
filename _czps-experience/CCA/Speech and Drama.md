<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>The Language Club is all about bringing stories to life through the medium of shadow puppetry and theatre. Our members&rsquo; voices and skills have entertained children of ages ranging from 3 to 12 years as we imparted morals through fairy tales and NE values through the re-telling of the Singapore story. We aim to let all our members showcase their skills both behind the screen and before it. Everyone plays a part.</p>
