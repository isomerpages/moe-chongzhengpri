<p><strong>Description:</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Speech and Drama CCA is a recreational club dedicated to nurturing
students' confidence and performance skills. Every student who joins our
CCA gets the exciting opportunity to perform, ensuring that all members
experience the thrill of being on stage.</p>
<p>Each year, our students get to enjoy the exciting experience of attending
a musical. Earlier this year, we had the pleasure of watching "Matilda
the Musical" at Marina Bay Sands, a memorable outing that inspired our
budding performers.</p>

</p>
<p>To further enhance their skills, our students receive guidance from a
professional acting coach during our CCA sessions. This expert instruction
helps them refine their techniques and develop their abilities in a supportive
environment.</p>
<p>This semester, we are thrilled to collaborate with East Spring Secondary.
As part of this partnership, eight of our students were invited to perform
in their school's musical at Victoria Theatre. This experience provided
them with invaluable exposure to a larger audience and a professional performance
setting.</p>
<p>Additionally, our CCA encourages students to share their love for literature
through book sharing on stage. These sessions offer a platform for students
to present their favourite books, fostering a love for reading and public
speaking.</p>
