<p>Modular CCA (Sports) provides opportunities for students to learn a variety
of sports and games over the course of 4 years. Students are taught basic
games skills and rules so that they can play and enjoy the game at a recreational
level. Over the years, our CCA members have had the opportunity to play
kin-ball, archery, tchoukball, badminton, basketball, soccer, fencing and
many more. Our CCA members can look forward to a different sport each year.</p>
<p>Modular CCA (Sports) is an excellent platform for students to discover
their interest in sports and keep fit. Through sports and games, we also
inculcate values so that students may grow and develop good character traits.&nbsp;</p>
