<p><strong>Description:</strong>
</p>
<p>Modular CCA (Sports) provides opportunities for students to learn a variety
of sports and games over the course of 4 years. Students are taught basic
games skills and rules so that they can play and enjoy the game at a recreational
level. Over the years, our CCA members have been introduced to sports such
as kin-ball, archery, tchoukball, badminton, ultimate frisbee, soccer,
fencing and many more. Our CCA members can look forward to a different
sport each year.</p>
<p>Modular CCA (Sports) is an excellent platform for students to discover
their interest and talent and keep fit. Through sports and games, we also
inculcate values so that students may grow and develop good character traits.&nbsp;</p>
