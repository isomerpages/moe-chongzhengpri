<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>The CCA provides opportunities for students to learn several sports over the course of 4 years. Students are taught basic games skills and rules so that they are able to play and enjoy the games at a recreational level. The students will be learning four different sports in a year, which include the&nbsp;<strong><em>3 core sports â€“ Netball, Soccer and Badminton</em></strong>. The other sports which our members have been exposed to include Indoor Archery, Cycling, Floorball, Fencing, Kinball, Volleyball and In-line Skating</p>
<p>The Modular CCA (Sports) is an excellent platform for students to discover their interest in sports and cultivate the love for sports as a lifelong active lifestyle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through sports, we inculcate good values in students through purposefully planned debrief sessions with the use of the CCA Facilitation Toolkit and leveraging on teachable moments.&nbsp;</p>
