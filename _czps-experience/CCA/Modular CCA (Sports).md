<p><strong>Description:</strong>
</p>
<p>The CCA provides opportunities for students to learn several sports over
the course of 4 years. Students are taught basic games skills and rules
so that they are able to play and enjoy the games at a recreational level.
The students will be learning four different sports in a year, which include
the &nbsp;<strong><em>2 core sports – Football and Badminton</em></strong>.
The other sports which our members have been exposed to include Indoor
Archery, Cycling, Floorball, Fencing, Kinball, Volleyball and In-line Skating.</p>
<p>The Modular CCA (Sports) is an excellent platform for students to discover
their interest in sports and cultivate the love for sports as a lifelong
active lifestyle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through sports, we inculcate good values in students through purposefully
planned debrief sessions with the use of the CCA Facilitation Toolkit and
leveraging on teachable moments.&nbsp;</p>
