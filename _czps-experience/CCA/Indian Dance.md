<p><strong>Description :</strong>
</p>
<p>The Indian dance CCA in Chongzheng Primary School aspires to develop the
passion and bring out the potential of each student in the area of performing
arts. It is made up of a small but enthusiastic group of students with
a passion for Indian dance. A strong set of values is instilled in each
and every student as they embark on their journey and this enables them
to discover their potential beyond dance.</p>
<p>Our students are exposed to different genres of Indian dance like Baratha
Natyam (Classical), Folk, Bollywood and Contemporary dance. Our Indian
Dance CCA is led by our Indian Dance Instructor, Ms Meenalochani.</p>
<p>Our students usually get the opportunity to showcase their talents and
skills not only during school events like the annual Deepavali Concert,
but also get the exposure to perform at external events like Singapore
Youth Festival (SYF), National Day dinner at Tampines Hub &amp; Community
centers &amp; Deepavali performances at different Community centers.</p>

the audience and adjudicators with their dynamic movements and facial expressions.

craft and become more proficient dancers, they have also forged strong
bonds with one another.</p>
