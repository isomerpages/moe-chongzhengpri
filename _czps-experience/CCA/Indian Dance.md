<p><strong>Description :</strong></p>
<p>The Indian dance CCA in Chongzheng Primary School aspires to develop the passion and bring out the potential of each student in the area of performing arts. It is made up of a small but enthusiastic group of students with a passion for Indian dance.</p>
<p>Our students are exposed to different genres of Indian dance like Thillana, Baratha Natyam, Bollywood and Contemporary dance. Our Indian Dance CCA is led by our Indian Dance Instructor, Ms Meenalochani.</p>
<p>A strong set of values is instilled in each and every student as they embark on their journey and this enables them to discover their potential beyond dance.</p>
<p>Our students usually get the opportunity to showcase their talents and skills during school events like the annual Deepavali Concert and Evening with the Arts. Not only do the dancers get to perform at school events, they also get the exposure to perform at external events during festivals and celebrations.</p>

<p>Chongzhengâ€™s Indian Dance CCA also clinched their first SYF certificate of distinction in the year 2018. Dancing to an Indian folk piece entitled Karagattam(Balancing of the head pot), the dancers showed poise and confidence on stage. They demonstrated a high level of skill and excellent coordination, enrapturing the audience and adjudicators with their dynamic movements and facial expressions. Through their involvement in the CCA, the girls have not only honed their craft and become more proficient dancers, they have also forged strong bonds with one another.</p>
