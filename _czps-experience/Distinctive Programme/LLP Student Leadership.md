<p>The Heart of the Framework is the &lsquo;Starfish&rsquo;- something which resonates with every student, the Starfish story inspires all to create positive impact by doing good to others.</p>
<p>With the 3 Es (Experience, Engage and Empower) approach, and guided by &lsquo;Self&rsquo;, &lsquo;Team&rsquo; and &lsquo;Thought&rsquo; Leadership, we hope to develop our Student Leaders into beautiful &ldquo;butterflies&rdquo;,&nbsp;<em>with a heart to give and a mind to grow,&nbsp;</em>anchored in our CZPS values and embodying the leadership qualities of being responsible, resilient, humble, empathetic and curious.</p>
