<p>Dear Parents/Guardians</p>
<p>Phase 1 registration is for a Singapore Citizen (SC) or Permanent Resident
(PR) child born between 2 January 2019 and 1 January 2020 (both dates inclusive)
and has an older sibling currently studying in our school.</p>
<p>Parents who are registering their child under Phase 1 are to register
during the Phase 1 registration period from <strong>9am on 1 July 2025 to 4.30pm on 3 July 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>If your child is a non-SC / non-PR and thus not eligible for Phase 1,
please submit an online Indication of Interest from <strong>9am on 27 May 2025 to 4.30pm on 2 June 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Information on the 2025 P1 Exercise had been published on the MOE website.
Thank you.</p><a class="isomer-image-wrapper" href="https://go.gov.sg/2026-phase1"><img style="width: 40%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="2026 Primary 1 intake (Interest Form)" src="/images/https___go_gov_sg_2026_phase1.png"></a>
