<p>Dear Parent/Guardian,</p>
<p>To ensure that schools continue to be a healthy and safe environment for
all, we require parents/guardians to make <strong>a travel declaration for your child/ward if he/she will be travelling</strong> for
the holidays.</p>
<p>To make a travel declaration for your child/ward via Parents’ Gateway
(PG), go to [SERVICE &gt; DECLARE TRAVELS].</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Please declare your child/ward’s travel plan(s), indicating both the country
and city of travel, and any city of transit, <strong>by Friday, 24 May 2024</strong> Only
one parent is required to make the declaration.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If your child/ward is <strong>not travelling</strong> during the holidays, <strong>no action is required</strong>.</p>
<p>When planning your travel, please refer to <a href="https://www.ica.gov.sg/enter-transit-depart" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.ica.gov.sg/enter-transit-depart</a> for
more information and updates. If there is a change in travel plan(s) after
declaration, please submit a new travel declaration via PG if there is
a change in travel destination or inform the school if the travel plan(s)
are cancelled.</p>
<p>Thank you for your partnership and support to keep our school safe.</p>
<p></p>
