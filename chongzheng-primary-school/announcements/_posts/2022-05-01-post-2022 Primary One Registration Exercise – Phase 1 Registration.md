<p>Dear Parents / Guardians</p>
<p>Phase 1 registration is for a Singapore Citizen (SC) or Permanent Resident (PR) child born between 2 Jan 2016 and 1 Jan 2017 (both dates inclusive) and has a sibling studying in our school.</p>
<p>If you have a SC or PR child eligible for Phase 1, please submit the online form at&nbsp;<a href="https://go.gov.sg/p1onlineform">https://go.gov.sg/p1onlineform</a> by Friday, 13 May 2022.</p>
<p>The school will contact you if additional clarifications and / or documents are required.</p>
<p>If your child is non-SC / non-PR and thus not eligible for Phase 1, please submit an online Indication of Interest between 31 May 2022 and 6 Jun 2022.</p>
<p>You may refer to the MOE website at&nbsp;<a href="https://go.gov.sg/P1reg">go.gov.sg/P1reg</a>&nbsp;for updates on the 2022 P1 Registration exercise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The above information with the online form has been posted in the Parent Gateway too.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
