<p>The school held the Prefect E-Investiture on 24 January 2022. The 2022 prefects were officially inducted and introduced to the Chongzheng family. The investiture is an important milestone for the prefects as they were presented with their appointment letters and the Head and Vice-Head prefects were officially appointed.</p>
<p>Our School Principal, Mr James Lim, addressed the prefects at the investiture and encouraged them to strive to be exemplary leaders and to exemplify the 5 Practices of Exemplary Leadership (Model the Way, Inspire a Shared Vision, Challenge the Process, Enable Others to Act and Encourage the Heart) based on the Leadership Challenge Model.</p>
<p>The school invited a special guest, Ms Poh Shih Yin, the school&rsquo;s new SAC Chairperson, who shared her experiences and words of wisdom to inspire our prefects and student leaders.</p>
<p>The ceremony ended with the presentation of the prefects&rsquo; appointment letters and badges. Our Head Prefect shared on the importance of having the positive attitude and resilience and our Vice Head prefects shared on the roles of a prefect in Chongzheng.

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><u>Student Leadership Training - Prefectorial Board</u></strong></p>
<p>The theme for our prefects this year is&nbsp;<em>&lsquo;<strong>Leadership is&nbsp;<u>about action,</u></strong>&nbsp;<strong><u>not about position</u></strong>&rsquo;</em>. The prefects will strive to be humble leaders who are empowered to take action. Our Chongzheng prefects are the ambassadors of the school and representatives of the student body. They take on various roles including performing morning duties to help and welcome their fellow schoolmates and they are presented with opportunities to learn to take on event management and lead the school in events.</p>
<p>As a school, to help them progress to be an exemplary leaders, especially in upholding the values of being confident and steadfast as well, as being a positive role model to their fellow school mates, the Learning for Life Programme (LLP) committee conducts regular meetings to develop their leadership skills and facilitate exciting discussions for our prefects to lead and run school-wide events like the EAS day and Teachers Day! Look out for the exciting sharing that will be hosted by our prefects for the school this year!</p>
<p>Anchoring on our belief that every student can be a developed as a leader and with the new implementation of the Leadership Pathway, we hope that our prefects will be inspired to take on their student leadership roles effectively.</p>
<p>We look forward to partner with our parents and external agencies to continue to inspire our prefects to model the way for their peers and to put into action their leadership values and skills.</p>
