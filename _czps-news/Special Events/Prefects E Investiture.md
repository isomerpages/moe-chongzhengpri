<p>The school held the Prefect E-Investiture on 24 January 2022. The 2022 prefects were officially inducted and introduced to the Chongzheng family. The investiture is an important milestone for the prefects as they were presented with their appointment letters and the Head and Vice-Head prefects were officially appointed.</p>
<p>Our School Principal, Mr James Lim, addressed the prefects at the investiture and encouraged them to strive to be exemplary leaders and to exemplify the 5 Practices of Exemplary Leadership (Model the Way, Inspire a Shared Vision, Challenge the Process, Enable Others to Act and Encourage the Heart) based on the Leadership Challenge Model.</p>
<p>The school invited a special guest, Ms Poh Shih Yin, the school&rsquo;s new SAC Chairperson, who shared her experiences and words of wisdom to inspire our prefects and student leaders.</p>
<p>The ceremony ended with the presentation of the prefects&rsquo; appointment letters and badges. Our Head Prefect shared on the importance of having the positive attitude and resilience and our Vice Head prefects shared on the roles of a prefect in Chongzheng. The prefects were then sworn in and they recited the Prefect&rsquo;s Pledge to commit their leadership to serve the school and their school mates.&nbsp;</p>
