<p>As Chongzheng commemorated Racial Harmony Day 2021 on 19 July, the theme, &ldquo;Common Spaces, Connected Communities&rdquo; calls for youths to play a part in protecting common spaces amongst us. The event aimed to encourage our students to strengthen trust and friendships among our communities in order to emerge stronger as a more caring, cohesive and resilient nation.</p>
<p>The watching of a video clip, &ldquo;I Am.&rdquo;, reinforced the importance of unity in our country. In the segment, &ldquo;Over to You&rdquo;, students&rsquo; awareness to various religious and cultural practices of Singaporeans was increased as they shared their experiences with one another.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our teachers also facilitated discussions on contemporary issues with the theme, &ldquo;Racial Harmony: On Common Ground&rdquo;. This engaged our students in heartfelt conversations on diverse cultures and multicultural issues. In role modelling &ldquo;Racial Harmony Begins with Me&rdquo;, teachers wrote personal pledges to show their support for multi racialism and integration in Singapore.</p>
