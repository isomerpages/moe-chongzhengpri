<p>Chongzheng Primary School celebrated the appointment of our new CCA leaders on the 13th of July with an E-investiture that was conducted during the CCA session. This year&rsquo;s investiture was conducted in class due to the pandemic. However, this made it all more meaningful as our newly appointed leaders had the opportunity to receive their badges from their Form Teachers instead. This was done in the presence of their classmates, who cheered and congratulated them on their achievement!</p>
