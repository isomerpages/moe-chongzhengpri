<p>CCA Fiesta is an opportunity for the CCA Leaders to promote their respective CCA and to entice the Primary 2 students to learn more about each CCA so that they can make an informed choice for their CCA next year. It is also a platform for them to show confidence in their oral communication skills and responsibility in manning their respective booth. For the Primary 2 students , it was a fun and engaging session.</p>
