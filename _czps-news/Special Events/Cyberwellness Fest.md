<p>Our Cyberwellness Fest was held over the last 2 weeks of term 1. Students engaged in discussions of cyberwellness issues during FTGP lessons and visited the Cyberwellness Exhibit at the foyer.</p>
<p>With increasing digitalisation in our lives, the students interacted with information to raise awareness of digital safety and security at the exhibit and played an interactive game where they could win tokens.</p>
<p>Let's continue to be vigilant and keep our online space safe for all.</p>
