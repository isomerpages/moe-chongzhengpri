<p>From 17 May to 22 May 2021, Chongzheng celebrated the inaugural CZ Biodiversity Week. Differentiated CZ Biodiversity Week SLS packages were designed for lower and upper primary students to learn more about the importance of biodiversity in our ecosystem and sustainability of Planet Earth with their family members.</p>
<p>There were also a series of hands-on activities. Our P1 and P2 students had fun creating endangered animals bookmarks while our P3 and P4 students planted 'mystery seeds'. P5 students were engaged in learning about water conservation in Singapore as part of their full home-based learning. Though the CZ Biodiversity Week has ended, we continue to role &ndash; model these initiatives in school and at home by practising Bring Your Own (BYO) and the 3Rs (Reduce, Reuse and Recycle)!</p>
