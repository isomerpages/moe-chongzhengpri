and prosperity. The Chinese New Year Fair came alive with the hustle and
bustle of students participating in the activities.</p>

the new year. Students learnt about the auspicious meanings of these food
through a Chinese traditional tossing game. Families often indulge in these
festive foods to usher in good fortune and happiness. Students also enjoyed
craft works such as mini dragon dance making, paper cutting and fortune
