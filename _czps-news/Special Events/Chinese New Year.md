<h4><strong>Roaring Tiger Year Celebrations at Chongzheng Primary School<br /></strong><strong>虎虎生威庆虎年</strong></h4>
<p>With the Covid restrictions still in place, our students and form teachers remained in their form classes and were engaged in the celebrations through the blended approach of Zoom and in class activities.</p>
<p>A total of 9 activities and programmes were planned by the Chinese Language Department. Programmes included ten terrific facts about tigers and the relevance of tiger in the Chinese culture, to allow everyone to know more about the symbolic meanings to the Chinese.</p>
<p>Students were also taught how to say the greetings, and engaged in craft work to decorate their classrooms. As part of the celebration, our judges visited all the classrooms and selected the best decorated class for each level based on the 3 criteria of the Chinese New Year theme, colour and sustainability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well done to all the classes for their efforts in creating a fun and lively atmosphere to usher in the new year and congratulations to all the winning classes for the awesome decorations! We wish everyone a happy and healthy New Year of the Tiger!</p>
