<p>This year Chongzheng Primary School is proud to share that we celebrated our Chongzheng E.P.I.C. Day on Tuesday, 8 Nov!</p>
<p>CZ E.P.I.C. Day is a day where we celebrate our pupils efforts as we Empower our Pupils to Innovate for the Community. On this day, our Primary 6 pupils, as part of their Project Work, will be setting up booths of their own creation to engage their school mates with fun activities, services and games!</p>
<p>They applied the Design Thinking approach through their innovation process and have created many wonderful prototypes to share with their fellow schoolmates!</p>
<p>This year as a platform to give back to the community, we participated in the President&rsquo;s Challenge as a school. Under the auspices of Project Work, our Primary 6 pupils carried our their publicity campaign to encourage the school community to make online donations.</p>
<p>This campaign took place till 18 Nov 2022. We are please to announce that we raised $4622, exceeding our initial target! 100% of the funds raised through the President&rsquo;s Challenge will be channeled to the beneficiary organisations.</p>
<p>We thank you for your generous support, as we do our part for the community!</p>
