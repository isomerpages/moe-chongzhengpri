The theme for this year's PAM Fest! is &ldquo;A Celebration of PE, Art and Music&rdquo;. Hence, a series of activities relating to PAM was held during the week-long festival, from 20 to 24 Sept 2021.</p>
<p>The opening ceremony of the PAM Fest! was held as part of the school's e-assembly program via pre-recorded videos. Our students were treated to an interesting music activity which required them to participate actively in their respective classrooms. The rest of the activities were carried out during PE, Art and Music lessons and also via the SLS, in line with the Safe Management Measures.</p>
