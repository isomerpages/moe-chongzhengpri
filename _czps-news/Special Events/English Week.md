<p>English Week was featured as part of the English Department&rsquo;s efforts to promote the language on a different platform. The focus of English Week 2021 was to provide our students with opportunities to build their oracy skills and to allow them to be understood by others. Therefore, the theme was &lsquo;Speak Well! Be Understood!&rsquo;. There were various activities lined up for the different levels to celebrate the English Language. Some of these activities included the students performing readers&rsquo; theatre scripts, tongue twisters as well as taking part in online oratorical contests. Students have indeed enjoyed celebrating the English Language this year!</p>
