<p>The theme for National Day 2021, &ldquo;Together, Our Singapore Spirit&rdquo; hopes to evoke our common Singapore identity and Singaporeans coming together as one united people. To put this theme into practice, the National Education team collaborated with the PE, Art and Music departments to make the celebration a more holistic learning experience for CZ students.</p>
<p>In the context of the current situation with SMM observed, the team planned a celebration which was simple, classroom-based, yet dignified and meaningful. Students participated in the &lsquo;Get Active Star Challenge&rsquo; and &lsquo;CZ Sing Singapore&rsquo;, with badges and prizes given to winning entries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the Observance Ceremony, our students were made aware of historical importance and solemnity of the National Day through the flag raising ceremony video, recitation of the pledge, singing of community songs and recollections.</p>
<p>Our students used the Kindsville booklets to learn about and reflect on the achievements of Singapore. From these activities, CZ students realised how blessed they are despite facing the challenging circumstances of COVID-19.</p>
